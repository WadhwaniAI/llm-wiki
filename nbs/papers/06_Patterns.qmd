# Design Patterns
> How LLMs be used & applied?



> **Pre-train, Prompt, and Predict: A Systematic Survey of Prompting Methods in Natural Language Processing **\
[Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.13586) | Code | Blog | Jul 2021 \
The new way of solving NLP tasks: pre-train, prompt, and predict.

>**Reasoning with Language Model is Planning with World Model **\
[Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14992) | Code | Blog | May 2023 \
LLMs as both world model, reasoning & planning agent. 

>**How Does Generative Retrieval Scale to Millions of Passages? **\
[Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11841) | Code | Blog | May 2023 \
An emerging pattern in LLMs is Retriveal Augmented Information Retrivesl. Can Google search be made generative?

> **Small Models are Valuable Plug-ins for Large Language Models  **\
[Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.08848) | Code | Blog| May 2023 \
Use small models to provide the context. Big models will do better.

> **Crawling the Internal Knowledge-Base of Language Models  **\
[Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.12810) | Code | Blog| April 2023 \
Interesting. Thefore, treat LLMs as indexed web, and create structured data from unstructred web.

> **Collaborating with language models for embodied reasoning **\
[Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.00763) | Code | Blog | Feb 2023 \
A planner- actor- Reported: multiple LLMs work with each other.

> **Describe, Explain, Plan and Select: Interactive Planning with Large Language Models Enables Open-World Multi-Task Agents **\
[Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.01560) | Code | Blog | Feb 2023 \
Better error corrections by breaking the task into chunks!

> **HuggingGPT: Solving AI Tasks with ChatGPT and its Friends in Hugging Face **\
[Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.17580) | Code | Blog | date \
LLMs as controllers.
